# Modular Code
I want my code to be modular please. That means we should always take careful consideration where we ought to place things in the file system. For this project, I have the `./pkg` directory which is to contain submodules which work together to accomplish the goal of this application. I may have a module responsible for creating initalization directories and such. That might live in `./pkg/dir` or something like that. That may not be the exact name, but you get what I mean. I do not want a whole bunch of files dumped into `./pkg` because this project is expected to grow and will need room for more submodules as we progress. Just trying to avoid the headache of modularizing later down the line and refactoring.
